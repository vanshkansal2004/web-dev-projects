            <p class="text">Adventure means searching for something new and unknown. Fewer people have the desire to adventure in our country. Doing any work without any selfishness is completely contrary to our nature and nature. We are utilitarian people. If we go on a journey somewhere, we go for a work that will either benefit us in this birth or make our next birth successful through pilgrim. The call of unknown object thrills and excites us. To find something that we have no knowledge of cannot be called a work of risk.</p>
            
            <p class="text">Adventure is the experience of some exciting activities. It is an unusual experience that comes from activities filled with courage, enthusiasm, and joy. It never thinks about the result. This can result in a positive that gives some gain and a negative loss and loss. However, the adventurers do not mind the consequences and continue their adventure.
